# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This project is a **frontend-only web application** for **buying and selling cars** (Theme 12: Vehicle Trading Management).  
The goal is to build a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate website using **HTML5, CSS3+, JavaScript (ES6+), and Bootstrap 5**.

## General Coding Guidelines

### 1. Commenting
- Every important code block **must include clear comments** explaining what it does.  
- The comments should help both human readers and AI tools understand the project structure and logic.  
- Example:
  ```html
  <!-- Navigation bar for main site pages -->
  ```

  ```js
  // Handle form submission for vehicle registration
  ```

---

### 2. Naming Conventions
- Use **meaningful and descriptive names** for all classes, IDs, functions, and variables.  
- All names **must be in English**.  
- Avoid meaningless or random identifiers like `div1`, `az71cd`, or `tempVar`.  
- Follow consistent naming styles, for example:
  - Classes/IDs: `car-card`, `vehicle-list`, `btn-submit`
  - JavaScript variables: `carList`, `selectedModel`, `updatePrice()`

### 3. Technologies to Use
- ✅ **HTML5** for structure  
- ✅ **CSS3+** for styling and animations  
- ✅ **JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactivity  
- ✅ **Bootstrap 5** for responsive design and layout components  

---

### 4. Technologies to Avoid
- ❌ Do **not** use React, Vue, Angular, or any heavy frontend frameworks.  
- ❌ Do **not** use Node.js backend code.  
- ❌ Do **not** use PHP, Python, or server-side logic — this project is **frontend only**.

### 5. Additional Notes
- Focus on **clarity**, **readability**, and **maintainability** of the code.  
- Keep the design **modern and responsive** using Bootstrap grid and components.  
- Prefer semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`).  
- Include placeholder content or dummy data if needed for layout previews.
